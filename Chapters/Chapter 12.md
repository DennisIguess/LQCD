- Ginsparg-Wilson only for PhD level
- anomalous symmetry $\rightarrow$ not from this chapter, but should know about it
- Chiral symmetry: Explicit symmetry from finite lattice spacing from Ginsparg-Wilson
- Which transformation leaves what invariant?
- Overlap fermion operator: $s$ not a Mandelstam variable, but just a random parametrisation

**Note:** get updated chapter 12 (discussion of limits for chiral condensates currently missing)
