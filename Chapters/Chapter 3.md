# Chrissi's Comments

- Standalone introduction to statistics
	- Bayes' theorem, probability distributions, etc.
	- Central limit theorem, etc.
- To be impressive: biases
- Jackknife:
	- from eliminating single elements
- Autocorrelation and binning
- know about $\chi^2$, minimise it
- know about fits, how and why, etc.
	- Least square fitting
	- Error bands
	- Not crucial, but chance to improve
- Exponential noise growth (only for best of best)


# Notes

- lots of definitions:
	- variance
	- standard deviation
- Fluctuation of standard deviation:
	- know about his $f_n$:
		- definition
		- values
		- meaning: probability that $x$ is within $n$ standard deviations of the distribution
- central limit theorem: everything is a normal distribution if you average hard enough
- Jackknife
- functions of averages
- bootstrap
