# Chrissi's Comments

- Which symmetries are broken and kept?
	- always keep gauge symmetry
	- e.g., rotational symmetry is broken
- Wilson gauge action!!!!


# Notes

- Definition of plaquette
- maybe look at Langevin again
- Haar measure, weird, but probably not _that_ important. Maybe just have general understanding of how and why we need this measure / integration
