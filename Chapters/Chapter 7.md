# Chrissi's Comments

- Bound gluon states
- Static quark potential
- Sommer scale, not super important, but look into it
	- Could pretend to not know to make him ask the right questions you can answer lol


# Notes

- Chapter generally not super important
- Should just know about some general stuff:
	- Existence of bound gluon states
	- Glueballs
	- Maybe Sommer scale
