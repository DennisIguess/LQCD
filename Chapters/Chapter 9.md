# Chrissi's Comments

- continuum limit and phase transitions _very_ important
- something about $\beta$
- dimensional transmutation
	- no derivation
	- know... more?
- Asymptotic freedom
	- recall plot of coupling strength
- Going to continuum limit = second order phase transition!!!!
- $\beta$-function
- Renormalisation group
- Simanzik-equation
- Continuum trajctory
	- Lattices for multiple $\beta$, larger $\beta$, smaller lattice spacing, extrapolate to continuum limit
