# Chrissi's Comments

- continuum limit and phase transitions _very_ important
- something about $\beta$
- dimensional transmutation
	- no derivation
	- know... more?
- Asymptotic freedom
	- recall plot of coupling strength
- Going to continuum limit = second order phase transition!!!!
- $\beta$-function
- Renormalisation group
- Symanzik-equation
- Continuum trajectory
	- Lattices for multiple $\beta$, larger $\beta$, smaller lattice spacing, extrapolate to continuum limit


# Notes

- Really should look into definitions of $\beta$-function, core QCD stuff
- Lots of things that need to be looked at in detail
- Look into critical surface again
