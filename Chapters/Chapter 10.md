# Chrissi's Comments

- fermionic path integral
	- not super critical
	- know we use anticommutation relations instead of commutation relations
- Wick theorem
- pion correlator
	- related to quark propagators
- don't focus on derivations here
- little focus on Grassman variables is okay
- No about fermion doublers(?) when taking naive integral
