# Chrissi's Comments

- Markov Chains:
	- E.g., know how to perform an integral using MC methods
	- Three state system
	- Kinda spaced out again...
- Convergence and Autocorrelation:
	- Concept of correlation and autocorrelation
	- general behaviour with increasing Markov time
	- Lots of technical details here that are **not** important
