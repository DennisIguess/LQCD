# Chrissi's Comments

- Markov Chains:
	- E.g., know how to perform an integral using MC methods
	- Three state system
	- Kinda spaced out again...
- Convergence and Autocorrelation:
	- Concept of correlation and autocorrelation
	- general behaviour with increasing Markov time
	- Lots of technical details here that are **not** important


# Notes

- correlator can be expressed as integral over distribution
- probability $\geq 0$, normalised
- definition of probability density via action

- what is a Markov chain:
	- explain three state system here
	- try solving Gauss integral with MCMC methods
- know time homogeneity, ergodicity, reversibility
- Metropolis:
	- accept reject according to probability
	- usual definitions of this probability to get Metropolis
	- convergence, autocorrelation
	- if chain is strongly correlated, discard elements
	- keyword thermalisation
