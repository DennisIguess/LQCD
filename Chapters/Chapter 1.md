# Chrissi's Comments

- I spaced out :(
- Correlation functions:
	- Relation to energy levels
	- Influence of temperature, $\beta$
- Discretization errors:
	- Relation to Trotter Formula, intermediate times
	- Most important: Know it exists, what it means


# Notes

- Harmonic oscillator
-  euclidean action
- what exactly a path integral is here and relation to action
- introduction of $\tau$ when dealing with euclidean action
- details to thermal system interpretation:
	- large temperature $\Rightarrow$ $\beta$ gets smaller $\Rightarrow$ $Z$ gets larger
	- check dependence of correlation functions etc. on $\beta$
