# Chrissi's Comments

- Hamiltonian
- Canonical variables
- Hamiltonian is sum of independent Harmonic oscillators
	- no derivation
- Global and local Metropolis
	- Problems of global update: Rejections at large volumes, huge autocorrelations
	- Solution: Local Metropolis:
		- Know of existence minimum
	- Know of Langevin
	- Know advantages and disadvantages of the chosen new algorithm, explain details
- Should know about momentum eigenstates
- Momentum operator generates translations in space
- Try to relate this chapter to normal QM
